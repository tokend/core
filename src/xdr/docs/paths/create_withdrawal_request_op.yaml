    summary: Create withdrawal request
    description: |
      Allows to create request to  withdraw assets from system. On request creation, withdrawn amount will be locked
      on target balance.
      For withdrawal reviewable request `REJECT` action is not allowed.
      On `PERMANENT REJECT`, withdrawn amount is unlocked.
      On `APPROVE`, tasks can be added and removed.
      If `pendingTasks == 0` and action being performed is `APPROVE`, withdrawn amount is sent to external account.
      Withdrawn amount is subtracted for `issued` field of the asset
      Withdrawal request cannot be autoapproved, i.e. it's not allowed to set empty (zero tasks) in any way, either
      through `KeyValueEntry` or on request creation(through `allTasks`).
